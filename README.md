# todo_application
A small utility driven todo application built using Django which allows you to create your personalized todo list with different priorities [high, med, low] along with relevant visualizations using Boostsrap. You can can even export and mail the todo list to yourself or someone!
The necessary files have also been created to deploy the same on Heroku.
You can access the same using  - https://todo-demo-anushri.herokuapp.com/
